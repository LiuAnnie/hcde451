    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Design and create a low-fidelity prototype of a handheld electric screwdriver. The design of
        the screwdriver should consider the following:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - variable speed control
        <br>
        - screwdriver selection mechanism (10 total screwhead choices)
        <br>
        - screwdriver direction selection mechanism (screw in or screw out)
        <br>
        - digital readout of number of screws screwed and screws unscrewed
        <br>
        - can be used right or left handed
        <br>
        - product dimensions are a minimum of 6 inches long
        <br>
        - contains a rechargeable battery
        <br>
        - weight is in between 1-1.5 pounds
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        To begin the designing process, I first thought of my past experiences with handheld electric screwdrivers to 
        help guide minimum expectations for my own prototype. I‚Äôve previously used a small cordless handheld electric 
        screwdriver and a larger cordless drill in various assembly and installation processes. If I‚Äôm not drilling 
        a hole through a wall, I prefer using the smaller electric screwdriver, because it‚Äôs lighter, more compact, 
        and easier to hold in one hand. The design for my lo-fi prototype was heavily influenced by my previous 
        experience with this electric screwdriver (shown below).
    </p>
    <img src="A1-Model_Prototype/electric_screwdriver.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Going to my sketchbook, I began sketching a version of this screwdriver above. I knew that this screwdriver 
        allows easy switching between screwdriver head types, because it‚Äôs magnetic. There are LED lights indicating 
        battery life, a long trigger allowing two fingers to activate rotation at one speed, a physical switch to 
        change rotation direction, and a port to recharge the battery.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I then sketched variations of this screwdriver that would meet all the desired components: variable speed 
        control, screwdriver selection mechanism (meaning at all 10 screwhead choices had to be housed on the 
        screwdriver), and a digital readout. I figured that the digital readout could be small and placed on the 
        top for easy visual accessibility between left and right-handed users. Speed could then be controlled by 
        pressure on the trigger, and the biggest challenge was how I would house and easily switch out 10 
        different bit choices. The following sketch is the idea I decided to prototype.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 80%">
        Remember these multicolored pens where you could select and retract the different colors by sliding a 
        knob? The way I designed my prototype to switch out between different bits was inspired by this mechanism. 
        Users would slide up and lock in their chosen bit type.
    </p>
    <img src="A1-Model_Prototype/retractable_pen.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        With this design, I began to work on my prototype.
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I constructed my prototype from foam, hot glue, cardboard, paper, foil, and tape. I carved the main shape
        out of foam. My biggest goals during prototyping were that it should be <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">comfortable, 
            easy to hold, and include as many components in my design above to allow for a more informative user test.</span>
    </p>

    <img src="A1-Model_Prototype/prototype2.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        As shown in the images of my prototype above, I had a change of mind during the process about how I would store and 
        select screwdriver bits. As I began to work on the retractable pen mechanism, I remembered how often those pens 
        would break. Since the end of the screwdriver would have to withstand vibration and rotating parts, this 
        particular mechanism may be prone to more breakage. I instead opted for a storage system where users could 
        insert and switch out the bits by manually selecting them and inserting the bit themselves. This would be 
        aided by magnets to snap the bits into position.

    <h2>Image Preparation</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        The first thing I did was decide what I wanted to turn into a cookie! I settled on Nintendo's

           style="color: deeppink">brick block</a>,

               style="color: deeppink">star</a>.
        I believed these would be fun shapes to work with, and the thought of
        modeling other items in the future to build a Nintendo cookie cutter collection seemed intriguing.
        I grabbed these images online, desaturated them in Photoshop, and prepped them to be vectorized with
        image trace in Illustrator. Once vectorized, I exported the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LiuAnnie/hcde533/tree/main/A1-Rhino-Model/DXF"
           style="color: deeppink">DXF file</a>
        for all three items to use in Rhino!

    <h2>Modeling the Cookie Cutters</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        After importing the DXF files into Rhino, I started turning the curves into solid models. For each cookie
        cutter, I first created offsets from the curves to create a wall thickness of 0.03 inches.
        <span style="font-style: italic">
        (I used a caliper to check the wall thickness of one of my cookie cutters at home to model one with the
        same thickness!)
        </span>
        I then extruded the walls to a height of 1 inch. In each of my cookie cutters, I had features
        that I wanted to show up in the cookie, but I also didn't want to push holes into the center of my cookies.
        Therefore, I modified my cookie cutters to create indents that would stamp lines when pressed into the cookie
        dough. Since I was unfamiliar with the thickness of rolled cookie dough, I looked up a cookie recipe online to
        determine what dimensions I needed to use to create the indents.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        While I did run into some issues during my process, I was able to work around them, and I'm happy with the final
        result! My cookie cutters are designed to create 4 inch cookies!üç™
