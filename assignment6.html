    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Design an application that has both a mobile and wearable component. Deliver the user flow of the complete experience, 
        a storyboard and graphical representation of haptic responses for the user, and a clickable greyscale lo-fi prototype of 
        the mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>The Design</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        For this assignment, I designed an augmented reality cooking experience that's supported by the Cooking Llama mobile application (inspired by the 
        Japanese video game series, Cooking Mama) and AR glasses with haptics. Designed with beginner cooks in mind, the idea is that users can wear these 
        AR glasses and view the recipe, guiding instructions, helpful tips, and be notified of cooking time completion without having to pick up a phone or 
        tablet to check this information themselves during the cooking process. Users select and upload recipes to the AR glasses using the mobile application, 
        and the glasses provide haptic feedback throughout the cooking journey.
    </p>

    <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Once I had my idea, I began storyboarding to illustrate the user's complete experience. I sketched this in my sketchbook first, before redrawing it digitally. 
        The storyboard showcases the user feeling hungry, putting on the AR glasses, entering the app, selecting and uploading a recipe, cooking with the glasses on, and 
        completing the dish successfully.

    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        After storyboarding, I created a sketched a rough user flow for the experience, largely focusing on the mobile application experience, before creating the 
        final user flow using Figma.

    <h2>Haptics</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Creating the user flow helped me think through what kinds of haptics the AR glasses would have. Here are the haptic patterns I came up with:

    <h2>Lo-Fi Interactive Prototype</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Once the storyboarding, user flow, and haptics were complete, I worked on developing the wireframes for the mobile application and making it interactive. 
        Users can test the experience of entering the app, 'connecting' their AR glasses, selecting a recipe, and uploading the recipe to the glasses.

    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        In addition to sharing my deliverables with 3 classmates for critique, I conducted one user test with one of my neighbors. During this user test, I first explained 
        the overall idea to the user before asking them to review and critique my storyboard, user flow, haptics graphical representation, and interactive prototype. I encouraged 
        my user to think aloud during the user test and to specifically mention what they liked, didn't like, and what they may have found useful about the design. By giving the 
        user my deliverables on my iPad, I was able to have them annotate directly on my designs.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I presented my video on critique day (11/09/2021) to my class and received feedback from my instructors and 7 of my classmates.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Critique Feedback and Improvements:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            Show vs. tell by including more shots of yourself having difficulty hanging the disco ball up.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Improvement: The introductory text messaging exchange could 
                overlay a shot of me attempting to hang the ball up.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Bring the text messaging back around at the end for a more complete resolution.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Improvement: There could be a brief two message exchange between the two texters 
                at the end, where one shares an image of the final stand and the other reacts.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">
            Add audio to the video to make it more exciting.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">I made this change!</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="padding-top: 10px;">
            The introductory text message exchange was a creative and concise way to set the scene and introduce the problem/need.
        </li>
        <li>
            The shots look well done, and the video is clear. There was no confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
            The redesign of the disco ball stand is successful.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        What I Would Do Differently in the Future:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            I wish that I had taken more photos throughout the process. I forgot to take photos of the 3D printed and laser cut components prior to assembly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allocate more time towards video planning, filming, and editing in the future! Although I did plan, I ended up scrapping a large portion 
            of my video plan, since it didn't look like what I had imagined when being executed. Make time to experiment with different shots!
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Key Findings and Learnings:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            Test the design throughout the process! If I had not tested my stepper motor's ability to spin the disco ball or my first redesign of 
            the stand during the process, I would have wasted a lot of time printing a structure that wouldn't have been supportive enough. Quick 
            tests help inform the design, reduce anxieties about whether something will work, and save time overall.
        </li>
        <li>
            This entire process was a lot of trial and error. I spent a little over 24 hours outside of class at the Mill working on the design, 
            3D-printing, laser-cutting, and assembly of this stand. I spent around 32 hours on this assignment total, including 3D-modeling, programming 
            the microcontroller, making shot lists, filming, and editing. During this time, I was able to make mistakes, learn from them, modify my 
            designs, and make multiple versions of different components.
        </li>
