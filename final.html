    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Design and prototype two shoe storage devices: a shoe rack and shoe stackers.
    </p>


    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Motivated by <span style="font-weight: bold;">usability</span>, for this solo final project, I created a <span style="font-weight: bold;"> stackable laser-cut 
        shoe rack and a 3D-printed shoe stacker.</span>
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I wanted to create something functional that would make my personal space more
        organized and efficient, and I was also interested in creating something that
        others could easily recreate and utilize by downloading my openly available Illustrator and
        STL files (on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LiuAnnie/hcde451/tree/main/Final"
        style="color: deeppink">
         GitHub!
     </a>).
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Here were my <span style="font-weight: bold;">key design decisions:</span>
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            The shoe rack's design must be shelf-height adjustable.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Shoes come in different sizes and heights.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe rack must be stackable.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">When more storage is needed, users should be able to cut another rack and place it on
                    top of the previous one. No modification to the rack’s design should be needed.
                    </span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe stacker should be compatible with different types of shoes.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Greater compatibility with different shoes makes the design more versatile and
                    applicable to the user’s closet.
                    </span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe stacker should print without support material.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Reduce material waste and printing time.
                    </span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe stacker should fit in the shoe rack.
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Both devices should work together!
                </span></li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        There were four main components to the final project:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            stackable laser-cut shoe rack
        </li>
        <li>
            3D-printed shoe stacker
        </li>
        <li>
            user test(s) for usability
        </li>
        <li>
            1-minute video demonstration
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Initial Sketches and Preparation</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Before I dove into prototyping, I began with a few initial sketches of my devices to illustrate
        what I had in mind.
    </p>
    <img src="Final/images/ideaSketch.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic; font-size: 14px"> <!-- CAPTION -->
        Idea sketches.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I continued by taking measurements of my space and shoes to get an estimate of how big
        the shoe rack and shoe stackers should be. Once I recorded these measurements, I
        sketched more final versions of both the shoe rack and stacker in my sketchbook with
        rough dimensions. From there, I began working on the CAD model for the shoe stacker.
    </p>


    <h2>Making the 3D-Printed Shoe Stacker</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I modeled the shoe stacker in SolidWorks, splitting the device into two parts, the stacker
        and the anti-slip patch that would be glued to the top of the stacker, to eliminate the need
        for support material.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic; font-size: 14px"> <!-- CAPTION -->
        Anti-Slip Patch CAD
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Once these pieces were modeled, I started the 3D-printing process. It’s approximately 9
        hours of printing total for both parts. The stacker printed without issue, but I ran into a few
        bed plate adhesion issues with the anti-slip patch and realized that my silver filament
        wouldn’t print the model properly. I fixed the bed plate adhesion issue by printing one
        patch at a time instead of two, and my other two rolls of filament printed the model
        successfully. On my first test print of the anti-slip patch, the circular grippy components
        would fall off the base. This was resolved by increasing the base’s thickness in the CAD
        model.
    </p>

    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic; font-size: 14px"> <!-- CAPTION -->
        Anti-Slip Patch Failed Print
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        After fixing the anti-slip patch, I used tape to secure the patch onto the stacker, and then
        tested for durability by inserting my heaviest shoes into the stacker. The stacker did not
        break and shoes did not slip off the top! From there, I repeated the above prints twice to
        have 3 stackers in total. The stackers can stack into each other to save space!

    <h2>Making the Laser-Cut Shoe Rack</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        The shoe rack was the most challenging part of my project.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I first designed how the shoe rack would stack. The top component of the shoe rack must
        allow the bottom of another shoe rack to sit on top. Designing in Illustrator, I created
        notches on the top and bottom edges of the side legs. These notches would fit together
        when stacked and would be secured with a clip.
    </p>
    <img src="Final/images/side_legs.png" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic; font-size: 14px"> <!-- CAPTION -->
        Shoe Rack Side Legs
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I made the shoe rack shelf-height adjustable by creating 9 different slots where the user
        could insert 1-2 racks. To change the shelf height, the user would simply slide out one shelf
        piece and slide it through another slot.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        My goal was to laser-cut all components for the rack, so I created a number of clips to
        secure parts in place and tested several different fits. Once I found a good fit, I cut
        multiples of the different kinds of clips I would need: ones to secure the shelves in place
        and ones to connect stacking racks. After cutting all clips, I realized that laser-cutting was
        a poor choice for making clips, because the edges of the material wear down over time,
        making the fit loose. This defeated the purpose of using a clip to hold materials together. I
        resolved this issue by modeling and 3D-printing the needed clips.
    </p>
    <img src="Final/images/clips_tested.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic; font-size: 14px"> <!-- CAPTION -->
        Myriad of laser-cut(and some 3D-printed) clips tested on the shoe rack
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Once the side legs, shelves, and clips were cut, I finished everything I had planned to make
        for the shoe rack, but once I assembled it, I realized it <span style="font-style: italic;"> wasn’t sturdy.</span> Even though the shoe
        rack was functional, it would wobble and sway back and forth.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I resolved
        the wobble by cutting the side leg pieces to include a notch along the left and right edges
        at the top and bottom. I placed laser-cut bars at these notches that would connect both
        side leg pieces and used the cut out wood from the slots to create cross bars on the back of
        the rack. The cross bars would be held in place by 3D printed clips as shown below. These
        temporary changes made the shoe rack sturdy, and now it was complete! The next step was
        creating the video demo and user evaluation.

    </p>


    <h2>Creating the Video Demo</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        There was a lot to fit into a 1-minute video demo, so I made a checklist of things I wanted to
        include and then I storyboarded!

    <p style="width: 80%">
        From there I recorded and edited. Here's my demo video!

    <h2>Evaluation and Testing</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Outside of receiving critique from my peers in class, I conducted one user test with a
        neighbor in my apartment building. I focused on testing the usability of both organizer
        tools. I encouraged the user to think aloud throughout the test.

    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the 3D-printed shoe stacker</span>, I wanted to evaluate whether it could withstand the weight of different kinds of shoes
        without breaking, hold shoes in place without slipping, and see how well it fits on the shoe
        rack. This was tested by having the user insert each of their shoes in the 3 stackers I
        provided and having them place the stackers on and off the shoe rack.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">For the laser-cut shoe rack</span>, I wanted to evaluate how easy it was to assemble, how many shoes it could hold on each
        tier (with and without stackers), and how sturdy it is. To do this, I had my user assemble the
        shoe rack, change shelf height, stack another shoe rack on top of the first one, and
        comment on overall sturdiness.        
    </p>


    <h2>User Testing Feedback and Critique</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Here is the feedback from my one user test and critique received from classmates as I
        worked on the final project and during the final showcase.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        User Test, Shoe Stacker:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">

            <ul>
                <li>
                    4/4 pairs of the user’s shoes were successfully
                    held without stacker breakage.

                    3/4 pairs of the user’s shoes held onto the
                    stacker without slipping.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    4/4 pairs fit on the shoe rack.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        User Test, Shoe Rack:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            Ease of assembly
            <ul>
                <li>
                    User said that the shoe rack is difficult to
                    assemble because the shelves don’t slide easily
                    into the slots. They mention that installing the
                    crossbars in the back is confusing, because
                    there is not a clear place to put them. They
                    gave assembly a 1/5 rating for ease of assembly
                    (1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Number of pairs of shoes held on each
            shelf with and without stackers
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Each shelf can hold 2 pairs of shoes without
                    stackers and 3 pairs with stackers. The user’s
                    shoes are larger than mine, so both pairs might
                    not sit flat on the shelf.

        <li>
            Changing shelf height
            <ul>
                <li>
                    User moved one shelf into another slot and said
                    that it was annoying to switch out since the slot
                    fit is too tight. They mention that they would
                    likely determine their shelf height before using
                    the rack and then keep shelf height as is after
                    assembly to avoid having to change shelf
                    height.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The user easily stacked the second shoe rack
                    on top of the first one with no issue.

            </ul>

        <li>
            Comments on sturdiness
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Without the crossbars in the back, the shoe
                    rack is very wobbly. It could still hold items on
                    the shelves, but the user wouldn’t put anything
                    valuable on the rack in case the rack falls over.
                    The shoe rack is much sturdier when the
                    crossbars in the back are installed.

                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        General Comments from the User Test:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            There should be a ledge that prevents shoes from falling off of the shoe stacker.
        </li>
        <li>
            The user would like to remove a stacker from the rack without having to touch the
            sides of their shoe.
        </li>
        <li>
            How to install the crossbars on the shoe rack should be made clearer.
        </li>
        <li>
            The clips to connect stacking shoe racks should be a tighter fit so that the user can
            lift up the shoe rack from the top rack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Overall, the shoe rack is nice and provides a good place to store things.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        Feedback from Classmates:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            “It’s really large! Consider scaling the shoe rack’s size down so it’s shorter.”
        </li>
        <li>
            “Instead of changing the model of the stacker, you can model clips to attach on the
            sides.”
        </li>
        <li>
            “Shoes might slip out of the bottom when you remove the stacker from the rack so
            think about adding an anti-slip patch to the bottom of the stacker too.”
        </li>
        <li>
            “I would totally use this! Could you forward me the files?”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        Overall message from feedback is to make the shoe rack easier to assemble and to ensure
        that shoes don’t slip off or slide out of the stacker.
    </p>


    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        What Worked Well:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            Both prototypes are functional!
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe stacker prints without support material.
        </li>
        <li>
            People that saw the shoe stacker mentioned that they would use it.
        </li>
        <li>
            3D-printed clips are much more successful than laser-cut clips. The print offers
            greater flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe rack is capable of holding a lot of items and is very sturdy when stabilized
            with cross bars.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        What Needed Improvement:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            The shoe rack could be easier to assemble.
            <ul>
                <li style="font-style: italic;">
                    Next Time: I would cut the slots to be larger so that the shelves slide in more
                    easily. I would also redesign the shoe rack to include permanent crossbars (the
                    current crossbars are a temporary solution) and indicate where they would be
                    installed with engravings.                    
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            The shoe stacker could grip onto the shoes better so that they don't slip.
            <ul>
                <li style="font-style: italic;">
                    Next Time: I would add an anti-slip patch to the bottom portion of the stacker,
                    and I would remodel the stacker to include a ledge on top to prevent the shoe
                    from slipping off the stacker. I would also model and print clips to attach to the
                    sides that would allow the user to pull out the stacker more easily from the shoe
                    rack.
                   
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold;">
        What I Would Do Differently Next Time:
    </p>
    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 26px; width: 80%;">
        <li>
            I would allocate time for uncertain issues that may arise during the prototyping
            process. I allocated 10 hours outside of class to work on making the prototypes
            (excluding video, user testing, blog, and report), but spent closer to 15 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allocate more time for video filming and editing. I expected the filming and editing
            process to go by faster.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check my design for any potential structural issues to prevent wobbling.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
        Overall, it was a fun project, and I'm glad to have more storage space now!
