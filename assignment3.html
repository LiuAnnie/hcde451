    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Design and build something that would be useful in your everyday life using 3D modeling and printing.
        The design must include the following primitive operations:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - Extrusion
        <br>
        - Revolution
        <br>
        - Boolean
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        A few weeks ago, I was gifted a lovely disco ball from a friend! Unfortunately, the disco ball is too heavy 
        for me to install on the ceiling without any screws. The disco ball has mostly been living on my couch and rolling around on the floor. 
        This assignment became my opportunity to design a 3D-printed stand to hold the disco ball in place! These are a few of 
        the key design considerations that I kept in mind:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The stand should fit nicely on a side table or coffee table. It shouldn't be wider
        than 5 inches in diameter.
        <br>
        - The disco ball has a hook for hanging at one end. While displaying, I want the stand 
        to keep the hook hidden.
        <br>
        - The stand should be minimal in design to not distract from the disco ball.
        <br>
        - The stand should ideally serve another purpose while not in use.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Since this model would be constrained by time to print and my own abilities to 3D model the 
        design, it had to be minimal and feasible. I decided to go with a cylindrical stand shape 
        with cutouts fit the disco ball and its hook. When not in use, the stand could act as a small 
        tray for hair ties/clips. It can even act as a large coaster. I went on to sketching and took 
        a few measurements to ensure the stand would fit the disco ball.
    </p>
    <img src="A3-3D_Printed_Object/sketch.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        The overall design is similar to that of a small bowl, however the top edges of the stand have 
        been cut to accommodate the curvature of the disco ball. This allows the ball to sit nicely on top of
        the stand. I also ensured that there was enough cutout space for the hook so that I wouldn't have to 
        fumble with it everytime I placed the ball on the stand.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        To make the CAD process faster, I wrote down all the steps I would take before any modeling. 
        Taking this step allowed me to verify that I've hit all three primitive operations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Modeling in SolidWorks</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I modeled the part in SolidWorks! I used revolution to create the walls of the stand, extruded the 
        base of the stand to make it into a bowl, and booleandifferenced/extrude cut the top edge of the stand 
        to match the curvature of the disco ball. Here are some images from throughout the CAD process:

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I then 3D printed the stand (4hr18min)!

    <h2>User Test</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I conducted one user test with my final prototype where I asked the user to place the disco ball on the stand 
        and comment on their thoughts about the experience and overall 3D model. During my user test, I tested for overall 
        usability, feasibility, and desirability.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Usability
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - I had the user place the disco ball on the stand.
        <br>
        - I observed how well the disco ball stayed on the stand, checking for sturdiness, if it was prone to fall over, etc.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Feasibility
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The user placed the disco ball on the stand again, but this time they hid the hook in the stand.
        <br>
        - I observed how long this task took to complete and looked for potential pain points (Is the cutout large enough to accommodate 
        the hook without having the fumble with it?)
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Desirability
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - During and after the user test, I asked the user what they thought about the disco ball stand and how they would improve it to
        be more desirable.
        <br>
        - These responses helped me think of future iterations of this design.
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        User Test Feedback:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The bottom of the 3D model is too smooth and slides around too easily. The stand and disco ball 
        could potentially slide off the table if pushed accidentally.
        <br>
        - The stand serves its purpose, it's easy to use, and the user likes it!
        <br>
        - Besides the (potentially slippery) bottom, the stand is sturdy and holds up the disco ball.
        <br>
        - In future iterations, the user thinks it would be cool if the stand could spin the disco ball.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Critique Feedback:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%;font-style: italic;">
        - In Progress (Critique on 11/2/21)
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        What Worked Well:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The stand printed with no issues and didn't require supports. Printed in 4 hours 18 minutes on a Dremel 3D45.
        <br>
        - The stand successfully holds up/displays the disco ball while hiding the hook.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        What Needed Improvement:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The bottom of the model is too smooth, making it more likely to slide off a table if pushed. To fix this, I could
        add rubber feet to the bottom of the model or the 3D model could be modified to accommodate the addition of adhesive 
        rubber feet (so it looks more flush with the table surface).
        <br>
        - The user suggested that I make the stand spin in the future! I agree! In a future iteration, I'd like to redesign the 3D model 
        stand to consider the addition of a motor.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Key Findings:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The bottom of the model needs to be modified so it's less slippery!
        <br>
        - Users were pleased with how the stand fulfilled its purpose.
    </p>
