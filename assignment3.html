    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Design and build something that would be useful in your everyday life using 3D modeling and printing.
        The design must include the following primitive operations:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - Extrusion
        <br>
        - Revolution
        <br>
        - Boolean
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        A few weeks ago, I was gifted a lovely disco ball from a friend! Unfortunately, the disco ball is too heavy 
        for me to install on the ceiling without any screws. The disco ball has mostly been living on my couch and rolling around on the floor. 
        This assignment became my opportunity to design a 3D-printed stand to hold the disco ball in place! These are a few of 
        the key design considerations that I kept in mind:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The stand should fit nicely on a side table or coffee table. It shouldn't be wider
        than 5 inches in diameter.
        <br>
        - The disco ball has a hook for hanging at one end. While displaying, I want the stand 
        to keep the hook hidden.
        <br>
        - The stand should be minimal in design to not distract from the disco ball.
        <br>
        - The stand should ideally serve another purpose while not in use.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        Since this model would be constrained by time to print and my own abilities to 3D model the 
        design, it had to be minimal and feasible. I decided to go with a cylindrical stand shape 
        with cutouts fit the disco ball and its hook. When not in use, the stand could act as a small 
        tray for hair ties/clips. It can even act as a large coaster. I went on to sketching and took 
        a few measurements to ensure the stand would fit the disco ball.
    </p>
    <img src="A3-3D_Printed_Object/sketch.jpg" width=80%>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        The overall design is similar to that of a small bowl, however the top edges of the stand have 
        been cut to accommodate the curvature of the disco ball. This allows the ball to sit nicely on top of
        the stand. I also ensured that there was enough cutout space for the hook so that I wouldn't have to 
        fumble with it everytime I placed the ball on the stand.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        To make the CAD process faster, I wrote down all the steps I would take before any modeling. 
        Taking this step allowed me to verify that I've hit all three primitive operations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Modeling in SolidWorks</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I modeled the part in SolidWorks! I used revolution to create the walls of the stand, extruded the 
        base of the stand to make it into a bowl, and booleandifferenced/extrude cut the top edge of the stand 
        to match the curvature of the disco ball. Here are some images from throughout the CAD process:

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I then 3D printed the stand (4hr18min)!

    <h2>User Test</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        I conducted one user test with my final prototype where I asked the user to construct the laptop/tablet stand and then insert the provided devices. 
        The user was encouraged to speak out loud about their experience during the test. The goals of the user test were to examine the prototypeâ€™s 
        usability, feasibility, and desirability.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Usability
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - I had the user assemble the stand, insert provided devices, and then disassemble the stand.
        <br>
        - This task allowed me to observe for points of confusion and where the stand could improve.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Feasibility
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - Testing for feasibility was explored through the fidelity of the prototype and the complexity of putting the stand together.
        <br>
        - If the stand was too difficult to put together, then it's not feasible.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Desirability
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - During and after the user test, I asked the user what they thought about the stand, if they would use it themselves, and how they
        would improve it to better fit their needs.
        <br>
        - Their responses allowed me to think of ways that the stand could be more desirable to other users.
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis + Critique Feedback</h2>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        What Worked Well:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - The stand is very easy to assemble and disassemble.
        <br>
        - Multiple notches along the base allow for customization.
        <br>
        - The stand feels sturdy when fully assembled.
        <br>
        - The stand successfully holds both a laptop and a tablet.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        What Needed Improvement:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - One slot is thicker than the other slot to accommodate larger devices. However there's no indication on the ribs about these varying thicknesses. 
        To improve the design in the future, I should add a marker, pattern, or make a change in the rib's shape that indicates this.
        <br>
        - In the future, I should wipe off the edges of the laser cut object before using. Some of the burnt residue from the cut material's edges transferred 
        onto the devices.
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%; font-weight: bold">
        Key Findings:
    </p>
    <p style="width: 80%">
        - Users found the design easy to assemble and disassemble.
        <br>
        - Users were impressed with how compact the final design was.
        <br>
        - The design could be improved by adding some markers that indicate the different slot thicknesses for a smoother assembly.
